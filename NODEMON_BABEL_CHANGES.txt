- Added a .babelrc file to describe what type of build to do. Babel can do a number of different types of output depending on the version of JS you want.

- installed nodemon, @babel/core, @babel/cli and @babel/preset-env in the package.json with --save-dev

- added nodemon script in package.json to refresh server on changes

- added build script to manually build our ES6 client JS (in client folder) into ES5 JS (in hosted folder)

- added watch script to automatically build our ES6 client JS (in client folder) into ES5 JS (in hosted folder)

- used our nodemon script to keep watching server code for changes and restart the server

- moved HTML page to hosted folder and updated server code to send that file instead

- removed JS from HTML page and put into separate JS file in client folder

- used our build/watch script to build ES5 JS file in hosted folder

- Added link to our HTML page to ask for the build script

- setup URL in server to send back the hosted ES5 JS file when the HTML asks for it
